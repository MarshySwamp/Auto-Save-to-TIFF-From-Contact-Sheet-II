# Auto-Save-to-TIFF-From-Contact-Sheet-II

It is recommended that you don't install this script in the Presets/Scripts folder, just in case there is a conflict with the default Contact Sheet II script. Run this script from Photoshop's File > Script > Browse command and or record it into an action for ease of use.
